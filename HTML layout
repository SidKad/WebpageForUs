<br>Empathy is a choice, and it's a vulnerable choice. Because in order to connect with you, 
I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling </p>

<h2>Who is a Computer Scientist? </h2>
<p>A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, 
the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.</p>

<h3>Why did we chose that major? </h3>
<p>Well, we chose to major computer science because of the great passion we have for computers. 
We both get really excited when there are tasks to be done on a computer. 
With our strong math, analytical and problem solving skills, we are positive
 we can make a huge impact to the world we live in today. 
Let me not bore you with our ancient history blah blah stories! </p>

<p><i><b><mark><q>Silence</q></b></mark> Is The Best Way To Keep Away From Problems.... </i></b>
Sid is a very <q>strong-willed</q>, and assiduous person. The best <b>PROJECT</b> he works on is HIMSELF. <b>Tell him</b> and he will<i> forget</i>, <b> teach him</b> and he may <i>remember</i>,<b> but involve him</b> and he will <i>learn</i>. He never learns from someone who agrees with him, but rather from someone who argues with him. Fortunately, every experience ends up teaching him something, <q>so he tries to turn his wounds into wisdom.</q><br>


<h1>About us!</h1>

<p>

We are a bunch of self-motivated individuals, who throught all circumstances still 
strive for excellence and we believe that you are capable of doing that too. 
<br> 
Let's face reality: It's hard, if not impossible, to feel motivated all the time.
<br>

Some days you just want to put your feet up, eat buffalo chicken nachos, and watch Netflix -- 
and not even good Netflix, but some crappy movie that you're only watching because you've 
given up on being productive and are complicit in filling your brain with dim-witted, mind-numbing entertainment.
But hey, sometimes that's what it takes to recharge your batteries. 
A nice little brain vacation.<br><br>If you're automatically sure that you know what 
reality is and who and what is really important, if you want to operate on your default
 setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying
 and miserable. But if you've really learned how to think, how to pay attention, 
then you'll know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to 
experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer hell-type situation as not only meaningful, 
but sacred -- on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the 
mystical oneness of all things deep down."<br><br><br>
